Planning:

A program to calculate how many plates of different weights it will take
to equal the target weight on a barbell for strength training.

// Inputs
    working weight amount

// Outputs
    how many plates per side and what size those plates are
    warmups and plates per side for each

// Processes
    how many plates per side for working weight
    number of warmups - how many plates per side for each warmup, 
            assuming 3 warmups at 45%, 65% and 85% working weight

// Mock-up

    Warmups:
    Weight  |   Plates / Side
    [45%]   |   # x LB, # x LB
    [65%]   |   # x LB, # x LB
    [85%]   |   # x LB, # x LB
    Working:
    [100%]  |   # x LB, # x LB
